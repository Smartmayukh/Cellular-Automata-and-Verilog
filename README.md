# Cellular-Automata-and-Verilog
Simulating various Cellular Automata designs on different topologies like Flat plane, Toroid, Morbius loop, Klein's bottle using Verilog.

One of the things which inspired me the most to read about Cellular Automata was the Lex Fridman Podcast with Stephen Wolfram. Here is a section of the podcast where Wolfram discusses about Cellular Automata and the Rule 30 prize

CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
Here is probably the last video on Conway's Game of Life by Professor John Conway before he passed away due to Covid

I made a video on Conway's Game of Life with Rule 250 as starting configuration. Here is the link

I wrote the Verilog code for a 16x16 toroid. Coding was the easy part but debugging took me some time as the toroid edges has some interesting properties which were giving rise to various bugs in the code.
